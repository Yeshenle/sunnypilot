<h1>openpilot-pc</h1>
<b>在pc设备上运行sunnypilot </b>
</div>

* CPU比较强大
* 有NVIDIA的GPU
* 有AMD的GPU

<h3>
1. 环境安装
</h3>

参考 [webcam安装步骤](tools/webcam/README.md)

<h3>
2. GPU支持
</h3>
<h4>
NVIDIA
</h4>

安装驱动
参考[官方教程](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=24.04&target_type=deb_local)

以下为官方教程精简:

```bash
# 确保安装的nvidia驱动是cuda12
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/9.7.1/local_installers/cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2404-9.7.1_1.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2404-9.7.1_1.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo cp /var/cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2404-9.7.1/cudnn-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cudnn
sudo apt-get -y install cudnn-cuda-12
```
![bug修复](docs/assets/ops_cuda.png)

按上图修改相应的文件和内容,之后`tools/op.sh build`编译,之后运行就行

默热配置的是`CPU`,按理说安装好相关`GPU`驱动会自动调用相应的`GPU`加速

<h4>
AMD
</h4>

参考官方教程


<h3>
3. 摄像机参数设置
</h3>

首先使用一些常规软件获取摄像头的内参参数(例如GMLCCalibration),主要是内参matrix矩阵
然后分别修改[camera.py](common/transformations/camera.py)和[ui.h](selfdrive/ui/ui.h)中相应摄像头的内参参数；另外根据自己的需求更改[camera.py](tools/webcam/camera.py)中的相机参数（像素和帧率，帧率最好是20的倍数，例如20,60）

<h3>
4. 数据分析
</h3>

参考 [juggler数据分析](tools/plotjuggler/README.md)

Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.

### Branches
| branch           | URL                                    | description                                                                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release3`         | openpilot.comma.ai                      | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release3-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`          | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`      | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes [ISO26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262) guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software-in-the-loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software-in-the-loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware-in-the-loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware-in-the-loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.
